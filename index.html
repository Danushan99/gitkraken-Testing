        <pre>Development of the GitHub.com platform began on October 19, 2007.[11][12][13] The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta release.[14]

            Organizational structure
            GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" (self-management).[15] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but salaries were set by the chief executive.[16][needs update]
            
            In 2014, GitHub, Inc. introduced a layer of middle management amid harassment claims made against senior management. Tom Preston-Werner resigned as CEO amid the scandal.[17]
            
            Finance
            GitHub.com was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[18] In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital.[4] In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million of venture capital in a series B round. Investors were Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital and other venture capital funds.[19] As of 2018, GitHub was estimated to be generating $200â€“300 million in Annual Recurring Revenue.[1] The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since 2007 and is located in San Francisco.[20]</pre>
